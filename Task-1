/*This code is a simple Python program designed to function as a basic calculator.*/
/*It starts by welcoming the user and prompting them to enter two numerical values.*/
/*Once the numbers are provided, the user is asked to select an operation from addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.*/ 
/*The program then executes the chosen operation and outputs the result.*/
/*If the user selects division, the code includes a check to ensure the divisor is not zero, preventing a division-by-zero error.*/
